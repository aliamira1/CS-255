# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project aimed to develop a system for DriverPass, a company providing driver training services. The client wanted a comprehensive system to facilitate online classes, practice tests, and on-the-road training reservations.

# What did you do particularly well?
I refreshed my knowledge  of creating diagrams in LucidChart as well as learned some new types of diagrams. I think all my diagrams except use case diagram came out pretty decent.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise my use case diagram to make it more comprehensive.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user needs by closely examining the client interview transcript and understanding the challenges faced by both customers and company personnel. It's crucial to consider user needs to ensure the system meets expectations, enhances user experience, and ultimately achieves its objectives.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When approaching software design, I prioritize understanding the business goals and user requirements. In the future, I would continue to employ iterative development and user feedback incorporation to iteratively refine the system design.
